## 📜 The Manifesto

POLITART is not a gallery; it is a **defensive layer for digital expression**. We believe that in a world of increasing surveillance and algorithmic curation, art must become uncapturable. 

Our mission is to decouple creative expression from centralized financial and social systems. We view cryptocurrency not as a tool for speculation, but as the fundamental infrastructure for a new, sovereign culture.

> **"Code is Law. Expression is Liberty."**

- **0% Centralized Control:** No venture capital influence. No central server. No kill switch.
- **Eternal Persistence:** Designed to outlive its creators through decentralized storage.
- **Sovereign Individuals:** A shared resource for builders, artists, and thinkers.

## ⚙️ Technical Infrastructure

Built for developers, audited by the community, and powered by decentralized logic.

### 🛡️ Smart Logic
Our contracts are optimized for gas efficiency and maximum transparency. Every interaction is verifiable on-chain, ensuring trustless execution of rewards.

### 📦 Immutable Storage
We utilize **IPFS** and **Arweave** to ensure that large-scale artistic files are preserved forever, independent of any central server or domain registry.

### 🗳️ Open Governance
The protocol treasury and parameter shifts are managed by the community through a **multi-sig, quadratic voting mechanism**. No single point of failure.

| Component | Status | Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protocol** | `Live // Node 0.1` | Solidity / Rust |

## 🛠️ The Core Principles

1.  **Sovereignty of Vision:** Merkle-root proof of existence is the only curation we recognize.
2.  **Economic Disobedience:** Decentralized finance to bypass legacy banking structures.
3.  **Algorithmic Neutrality:** Influence is earned through contribution, not data extraction.
4.  **Persistence:** Art on POLITART is immutable and censorship-resistant.
